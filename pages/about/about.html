        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am Jacob Samson Aina, I am fresh graduate of Lagos State University(LASU),<br>
            I am 22 years old and I have always be that career type of person, I am web developer<br>
            without out any company experience yet or rather i haven't work on a real life project yet<br>
            I spent most of my school days trying to build up my coding skill and also I had to balance my<br>
            academic activities and performance, it has not been easy though but we thank God.<br>
            So right now i want to focus on getting a good paying job and also continue building up my skill.
